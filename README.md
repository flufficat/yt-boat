## FAQ
- Q: X video wont download, why?
- A: yt-boat will work for any video site that yt-dlp can download, it does not download videos itself, if there is an issue with downloading videos submit a bug to https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#opening-an-issue. To see yt-dlp's FAQ go to https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube
- Q: Adding a video to queue wont work?
- A: Make sure you have either selected a video in a feed by using arrow keys or are in a "article" (by pressing on enter from a feed)
- Q: After I update, I can run update again and it does another update, why?
- A: The update simply pulls the latest version of the yt-boat file from the releases and replaces the old one with it so it will continue to do that if you run update again.
- Q: I am getting Error: Queue file may not exist, see FAQ's
- A: For some reason the queue file may have been deleted, this program can't do that so it is probably for another reason. Just add a new queue file at $XDG_DATA_HOME/yt-boat/newsboat.queue by entering these commands:
	- `mkdir $XDG_DATA_HOME/yt-boat`
	- `touch $XDG_DATA_HOME/yt-boat/newsboat.queue`
