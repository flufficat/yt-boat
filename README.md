## FAQ
- Q: X video wont download, why?
- A: yt-boat will work for any video site that yt-dlp can download, it does not download videos itself, if there is an issue with downloading videos submit a bug to https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#opening-an-issue. To see yt-dlp's FAQ go to https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube
- Q: Adding a video to queue wont work?
- A: Make sure you have either selected a video in a feed by using arrow keys or are in a "article" (by pressing on enter from a feed)
- Q: The queue wont clear I am getting error `Cannot open query feeds in the browser!` in Newsboat?
- A: For some reason in Newsboat clearing will only work when you are in a feed or article, I dont know why at this moment so I can't fix it, if you know why please submit an issue titled `Fixing clearing in Newsboat`
